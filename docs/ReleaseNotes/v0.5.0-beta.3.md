# Sharp Bridge v0.5.0-beta.1

⚠️ **This is a pre-release version for testing purposes**

## What is Sharp Bridge?

Sharp Bridge is a **lightweight, real-time VTube Studio Plugin** that connects iPhone's VTube Studio to VTube Studio on PC.  
It transforms iPhone blendshapes into custom VTube Studio parameters, with advanced mathematical expressions and custom non-linear interpolations supported.


## Why Sharp Bridge?

### 🚀 Lightweight

We're a self-contained .NET-based executable with minimal resource usage - you can run it on a potato with 40Mb of RAM available and a spare change your CPU can offer.  
GPU Usage? What's a "GPU"?    
We're also **console-based** - because you can't have a heavy GUI if you don't have a GUI :3  

### 🆓 Completely Free!

No subscriptions, no paid features, no limitations. You're welcome.
