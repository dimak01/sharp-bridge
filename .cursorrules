# Sharp Bridge - Custom Instructions for Cursor

## Project Overview
Sharp Bridge is a .NET/C# application that bridges iPhone's VTube Studio to VTube Studio on PC. It receives tracking data from the iPhone, processes it according to user-defined configurations, and sends the transformed data to VTube Studio running on PC.

- **docs/Technical/Architecture.md** - Detailed architecture overview, component descriptions, and system design
- **docs/Technical/DevelopmentGuide.md** - Development workflow and best practices
- **docs/Technical/ReleaseProcess.md** - Release management and versioning procedures

### User Documentation

- **docs/ReleaseNotes/** - Release note files

## Development Guidelines

### Architecture Principles
1. **Resilient, orchestrated data flow** with automatic recovery capabilities
2. **Console-based user interface** with real-time monitoring
3. **Consolidated configuration system** with hot-reload capabilities
4. **Parameter synchronization** with automatic VTube Studio management

### Key Components
- **VTubeStudioPhoneClient** - Receives tracking data from iPhone via UDP
- **TransformationEngine** - Processes tracking data according to configuration rules
- **VTubeStudioPCClient** - Sends transformed data to PC VTube Studio via WebSocket
- **ApplicationOrchestrator** - Coordinates flow between components with recovery logic
- **Console UI System** - Real-time status display and interactive controls

### Code Organization
- **src/Interfaces/** - All interface definitions
- **src/Models/** - Data models and DTOs
- **src/Core/** - Core business logic implementations
- **src/Infrastructure/** - Infrastructure services and utilities
- **src/UI/** - Console UI components and formatters
- **src/Configuration/** - Configuration management
- **tests/** - Unit tests organized by component
- **configs/** - Configuration files and templates

### Configuration System
- Single but modular `ApplicationConfig.json` file for all settings
- Hot-reload capabilities for configuration changes
- Transformation rules in separate JSON files

### Testing Strategy
- Comprehensive unit tests for all components
- Test data in `tests/TestData/`
- Mock implementations for external dependencies
- 100% branch coverage expectation
- Coverage reporting with coverlet

### Version Management
- Semantic versioning (SemVer) for releases
- Use `IVersionService` for version display in UI
- Assembly versioning in `.csproj` for CI/CD

## Development Workflow
1. Always refer to existing documentation when implementing new features
2. Follow the established architecture patterns
3. Update relevant documentation when making significant changes
4. Ensure proper test coverage for new functionality

## When Helping with Code
- Consider the resilient architecture and recovery patterns
- Maintain the console UI system's design principles
- Follow the existing configuration management approach
- Consider the real-time nature of the application
- Use constructor injection and interface-based design
- DTOs are immutable - return new instances, don't mutate existing ones

## Documentation Updates
When making significant changes, consider updating:
- README.md for user-facing changes
- docs/Technical/Architecture.md for architectural changes
- docs/UserGuide/ for user workflow changes
- docs/ReleaseNotes/ for new features or breaking changes
